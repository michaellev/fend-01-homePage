My 1st frontend project - a 1 week self exercise - an audition for being accepted for front-end course.
I made it as my home page, containing;
    1. My Jewish Thinking Articles.
    2. My youtube channel.
    3. A memory game.

My background: Asm 85/86, C, C++, C#, Window Forms, Java, iOS Objective-C and Swift, and now Fron-End.
